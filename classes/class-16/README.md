The attachement next to this file is a zipped Obsidian vault. What does that mean?

Well, it means that it contains .md files (readable text files) that have been linked between each other. It is recommended you use Obsidian to open that vault and modify it as you wish, even expanding it into your own Wiki.

However, if you are not interested in using Obsidian, feel free to use the files as you wish. They are still .md files after all.
