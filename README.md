## How to send general questions?
<mark style="background-color:#3333FF">The idea will be for the participants to raise questions directly to their mentors<mark>.

**Unless** they feel the question could benefit other participants. In that case please follow these steps to create a new "Issue" and the question with the answer will be recorded and remain in the repository for everyone to check before asking the same question.
